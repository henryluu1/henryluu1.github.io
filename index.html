<p>In a society that is so dependent on the progression of past, current and future technologies, all people within this society begin to develop a desire to the notion and theory of mobility. This notion of mobility is a generalised term that has become somewhat evocative; in which encompasses the physical movement of people and the travelling of material objects (Hannam, Shelly & Urry, 2006). Although the idea of mobility is not new, this notion has become more prevalent and can be more easily seen when in contrast to the past and current movements such as nomadic living and mobile technologies. <p/>


<p>This idea of mobility could also be defined as a social paradigm into the movement of people, ideas and social implications (Urry, 2007) or the movement of people, as from one social group, class, or level to another. It in turn alters the way people perceive time and space; how it is more effectively and efficiently used also where and when it is used. A widespread technology that embodies changes in the movement of people and travelling of material objects is the mobile phone also known as the cell-phone. <p/>


<p>It was through mobility that the prehistoric nomads who lived as hunter-gatherers thrived. They traversed through land in order to search for food and to follow their prey. Although this would be extremely time consuming and whilst only covering a minimal amount of space. This is an example of mobility whereby the productivity within a given time and space was very miniscule limited by non-existent modern technology. One the other hand, the emergence of mobile phones added elements such as instantaneous communications on-the-go, but with it arises issues alongside the technology. Security of personal information is endangered as a result of such capabilities from modern technology such as smartphones and would not exist in the prehistoric nomad ages. This shows such multiple and intersecting mobilities seem to produce a more ‘networked’ patterning of economic and social life, even for those who have not moved (Hannam, Shelly & Urry, 2006). <p/>


<p>The smartphone in today’s society is where this desire and dependency on mobile technology is reiterated. It allows one to instantaneous work, play and communicate in the most efficient and productive manner and can be considered a central cultural technology in its own right (Goggin, 2006). Hence why it can be said that the faster the progression of technology moves, the time taken to do certain things within a limited amount of space is reduced. Work, play and communication can be done and condensed to an instant. </p>
